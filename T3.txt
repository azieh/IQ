Better is used in Version 2. 
In Version 1, Entity Framework context creates SQL request by casting entity to list object. At this moment we create a call with all data inside a table with redundant information(select * from MyTable). After that, we call Count() method where we calculate the number of entities using local computer resources.
In better, Version 2 we create an object of IQueryble<MyTable> where the call is not started. We can work on that object to tell Entity Framework what exactly we need.
By start rows.Count() Entity Framework should call something like Select Count() From MyTable. That will happen much much faster than Version 1.
